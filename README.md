# UFOs Ｓightings with Javascript
Using `Javascript` to build dynamic webpages and other customization tools that include Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to learn how to build a table using data stored in a `JavaScript` array and to create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
In this exercise, we reviewed how to display default data in the table, listen for a button click or trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria. Finally, we use `HTML`, `Bootstrap` and `CSS` to read the `Javascript` code and create a webpage that is easy to view, includes filters, images, and a synopsis of the topic.

## Topic

Our task is to help **Dana** with building a webpage in which others can access information of reported sightings and see for themselves. This webpage should include:

* A description or summary of the topic 
* A table to display all of the information from the data source
* Search filters that will allow for visitors to update the table based on the search criteria they enter.    

## Results

The webpage **[UFO Sightings - The Truth is Out There](https://github.com/tiffanylin706/UFOs/blob/1000ab722d6f805b8dbbc5c1c6200651f0791d91/index.html)** is being created.

 **"Filter Search"** section has been added. You can filter by one or all of the search criteria shown.

For example, if you add a shape, the table will update filtering further to only display the information containing that shape.

## Summary

**Drawbacks:**

Unfortunately, the page has several drawbacks. They include:

* The search field is "case-sensitive". The table will not update if you do not enter exactly how the data is stored and does not allow for partial entries. 

* There is no "enter" button to click after you type in the search words, you can only hit the " enter" on your keyboard.

* Data is outdated. It doesn't give us the latest data.

**Recommendations for further development:**

There are some recommendations in order to make the webpage more user friendly:

* Add additional customizations, such as click-buttons, dropdown list, and/or auto-fill that can help "guide" the user and make the page more interactive.

* Add functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data not limited to only the United States, but globally.
 
* Add "images" column. Images can give your visitors the power to visualise and imagine utilising them.
